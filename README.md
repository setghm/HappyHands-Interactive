# HappyHands Interactive.
_By Set HM 2023_

An application designed for children to use, learn the animal species, different shapes and colors, and demonstrate their skill and memory.



## Used technologies.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org)
- [serialport.js](https://serialport.io)

## Description and instructions.

The application can be managed with a mouse or with control made in a circuit using any microcontroller that can communicate through serial communication.

For the control to work, it must send a signal to the serial console that includes 2 characters: the color of the button pressed (Y for yellow, B for blue, or G for green) and the action (R when a button is released or P when a button is pressed).
For example:
- 'BR' indicates that the blue button has been released.
- 'YP' indicates that the yellow button was pressed.

Once the control is connected to the computer where the application will be used, on the home screen, at the bottom right there is a button that says "Update", press the button and then select your device from the drop-down list.

_Detailed instructions about the control comming soon..._
